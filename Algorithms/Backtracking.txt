Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, removing solutions that fail to satisfy the problem‚Äôs constraints at any point in time (by backtracking and trying another path).

How Backtracking Works:
‚òÖ Choice: At each step, make a choice that seems to lead toward a solution.
‚òÖ Constraint: If the choice leads to a violation of the problem constraints, backtrack and try another choice.
‚òÖ Goal: If the choice leads to a solution, mark it and proceed to the next step.

Example: Solving the N-Queens Problem
The N-Queens problem is a classic example of backtracking. The problem is to place N queens on an 
ùëÅ √ó ùëÅ chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.
